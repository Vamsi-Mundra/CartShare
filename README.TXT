3. Pool leader needs to select a store before ordering, after order is completed selected store gets cleared automatically, so reselection is required,
Accept to pool should be done through email when someone applies to the pool. Also address update to profile is madatory before placing the order.

4. We have used maven so mvn clean install would create a jar file in target folder, then java -jar <jar-name> would run the app.
